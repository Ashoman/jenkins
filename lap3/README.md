## **JENKINS TASK 3**

## **1- what is the benefit of using master-slave architecture rather than building on master only ?**


- ### Jenkins master-slave architecture, also known as Jenkins distributed architecture, allows you to distribute the build and test workload across multiple nodes or agents, which can help you to achieve better scalability, reliability, and performance compared to building everything on the Jenkins master node.

## **2- what is different between authorization and authentication ?**

- ###Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system. It ensures that the person or system attempting to access a resource is who they claim to be. Authentication is typically achieved by requiring the user to provide some form of credentials, such as a username and password, a smart card, or a biometric factor like a fingerprint or face recognition.
